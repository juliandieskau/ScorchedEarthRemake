# ScorchedEarthRemake
Godot Project from School back in December 2019

## Background
School Project over half a year to get marked, made while on vacation. I liked playing the Scorched Earth game on an emulator together with my uncle 
and also enjoyed watching Videos from the ShellShock Live Game and this is my adaptation to those two in the Godot Game Engine.

## Scorched Earth
Scorched Earth is a shareware artillery video game. It was released for MS-DOS in 1991, originally written by Wendell Hicken using Borland C++ and Turbo Assembler.
Players control tanks to do turn-based battle in two-dimensional terrain, adjusting the angle and power of each tank turret before each shot. (source: Wikipedia.org)

## Godot
Made with Godot v3.1-beta3 on Windows. 

## Trigger Warning
This game has some satiric content that might trigger some people. This includes cartoon-ish weapons that include jokes that depict historic events in a comical way.
This is only meant in a joking way - not to offend anyone or downplay the suffering of victims of the events.
